Hello! I am Denzel Manz S. Perez, the creator of this website.

First of all, if you're reading this, I would like to thank you for
your interest in my website for whatever purpose.

Now let me introduce you to my Online Recipe Aggregator Platform, Al'cremie.


Al'cremie is originally meant for a college project, which soon turned out to be
one of my favorite personal works.

Al'cremie lets you input your available ingredients in your pantry and uses that
information to bring you recipes that are compatible to what ingredients
you currently have.

It is made particularly for people who are just starting out on cooking and are
struggling to explore new recipes but it can also be used by people of
all culinary expertise.


With that said, the scope of Al'cremie doesn't include the actual instructions
on how to make the said recipe, there's already plenty of that going around in
the internet. Al'cremie is only responsible of making something out of your pantry.


With all that said, happy cooking to you all!
